# Rejected: bad-skill
- **Source:** https://github.com/example/sketchy-repo
- **Date:** 2026-01-15
- **Scores:** Structure: 2 | Value: 2 | Quality: 1 | Security: 2 | Adaptability: 2 | Total: 9/25
- **File Audit:** SKILL.md, scripts/setup.sh (executable — not inspectable, repo is private)
- **Reason:** Vague description ("does things, helps with stuff") provides no trigger criteria. References an external script with no explanation of what it does. Quality score of 1 — instructions are not actionable.
- **Revisit?** No — fundamental quality issues, not just polish.
