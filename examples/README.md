# Examples

Sample skill directories showing the expected structure for vetted and rejected skills.

## sample-vetted/my-skill/

A minimal skill with correct SKILL.md structure: YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `source`, and `trust_tier`, followed by a markdown body with clear trigger conditions and a step-by-step workflow.

## sample-rejected/bad-skill/

A skill that failed vetting (scored 9/25). Includes a `REJECTION.md` showing how to document the decision with scores, reasoning, and whether to revisit.
